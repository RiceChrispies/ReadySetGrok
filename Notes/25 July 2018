I have decided that something is fundamentally wrong with how I am structuring this project, so I am going back to the drawing board, so to speak. I don't think my MVC system is set up correctly, so I'm doing some reading about web dev in general and MVC in particular. I'm starting with this:

In this article, the writer recommends a series of other topics to read up on:

So, that's the plan for tonight.

Model: Maintains the relationship between Object and Database and handles validation, association, transactions
View: A presentation of data in a particular format, triggered by a controllerâ€™s decision to present the data.
Controller: The facility within the application that directs traffic, on the one hand querying the models for specific data, and on the other hand organizing that data (searching, sorting) into a form that fits the needs of a given view.

Stopping after reading the first one as my eyes are getting heavy. Pick up here tomorrow.
